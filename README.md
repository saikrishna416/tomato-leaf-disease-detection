# 🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Detection System
This project is a web-based application that detects diseases in tomato leaves using Deep Learning.  
It is built using Python, Flask, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

The main goal of this project is to help in early detection of plant diseases by analyzing leaf images.

## 📌 About the Project
In agriculture, plant diseases can reduce crop productivity.  
To address this problem, I developed a machine learning model that can classify tomato leaf diseases from images.

The system allows users to upload a tomato leaf image, and the application predicts the disease type along with confidence score. It also provides suggested remedies for the detected disease.

This project combines machine learning with web development to create a practical real-world solution.
